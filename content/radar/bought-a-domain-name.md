Cloudflare is like the best thing ever btw

New domain is [newtbytes.cc](https://newtbytes.cc) :3 I bought the domain for with Cloudflare and omg i adore the features they offer!! Cloudflare’s plans are definitely one of the few software subscriptions nowadays that are very much worth the price and the subscription model. And you get so much for free!!

Only thing I’m worried about now is that I want to continue being on neocities, but I can’t afford to pay the $5/month so I can use a custom domain. That’s fine though, I’m technical enough that I can find a free way to host the site. I still think I want to participate in the social media-like side of neocities, so I technically still need a site on neocities to do that. Hopefully I could just set it up so that [newtbytes.neocities.org](https://newtbytes.neocities.org) redirects to [newtbytes.cc](https://newtbytes.cc), but I don’t know how to do that yet lol. We’ll see.

I also would love to get into homelabbing and hosting stuff for my website at home, though I don’t really have the hardware quite yet. Maybe I could buy a cheap old used laptop (<$50) or something, idk :3
